<h1>Ian,</h1>
<br>
<p>It is my hope that this message finds you in the cycle of deep rumination. This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill – the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill – you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes. Remember, all I'm offering is the truth, nothing more.</p>
